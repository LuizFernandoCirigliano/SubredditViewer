[Here is an excellent guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/mod101) for starting and moderating your own subreddit.  \n\n* Moderators are people, too, so if you want your voice heard consider messaging them politely with your concerns. We care about the communities we help run and would hate to see users leave because of something that we can help fix!  \n\n\n---\n\n## What if I need help with something else?  \n\n* Try /r/help for general help on reddit. /r/askmoderators can also help you out if you need to ask mods about anything.  \n\n## I think I found a bug.\n\n* Uh oh. If you are using an application or extension, most have a subreddit you can post in! (/r/RESIssues, /r/alienblue, /r/redditisfun). If you found a bug with reddit itself, post it to /r/bugs (more serious issues should be sent directly to the reddit security team: see the /r/bugs sidebar for contact information.)  \n\n\n##Other Subreddits of Note\n\n* Other good subreddits to check out for help with various topics are /r/Modhelp, /r/Modnews, /r/ChangeLog, /r/Blog, and /r/Announcements.\n\n---  \n\n[Read more about reddit and how it works.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq)  \n\n[Also, see the FAQ on /r/help!](http://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq)\n",
